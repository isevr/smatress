Test bed setup:

On one bed 2 devices are installed:
- A grid of pressure sensing material 8x16 (8 colums, 16 lines - the bed height) that reads teh pressure every 2 minutes (file: Pressure.xlsx)
- A pneumatic sensor (WIthings Sleep Analyzer) that read the heart rate and breathing, the following data are recorded / calculated by the Sleep Device.
  file: Withings_Data.csv the following data are captured.

In order to corellate the data use :

Pressure.xlsx - Date 
Withings_Data.csv - Start Date - End Date.

The data are not one to one, so the proper methodology should be used for,
e.g.  Spearman Correlation and Kendall Correlation (just a suggestion)
